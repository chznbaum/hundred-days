# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

  password: "passwordpassword"
}
# column: value
#
two: {
  email: "example2@example.com",
